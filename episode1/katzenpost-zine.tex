%% CONTENT GOES BELOW

\section{non-anonymous communication}

ALL Internet communication protocols are NOT anonymous. This means
they snitch on you, your IP address and geographic location. If you
are a journalist, whistleblower, activist, revolutionary, or just a
normal fucking human being that doesn't like to be spied on then this
shit is relavant to you.

\newpage

Here's a list of companies, services and protocols which are NOT anonymous:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Telegram
  \item Signal
  \item WhatsApp
  \item Wire
  \item Twitter
  \item Facebook
  \item Google
  \item Bitcoin
  \item Bittorrent
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section{But Signal is end to end encrypted, doesn't that mean it's anonymous?}

NO!!! Signal is NOT anonymous and high risk people should NOT be using it.
Services like Signal which are end to end encrypted leak all kinds of metadata such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item IP address
\item geographic location
\item message size
\item message sequence
\item message receiver
\item message sender
\item entire social graph
\end{itemize}
