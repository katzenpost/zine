%% CONTENT GOES BELOW

We're all under more surveillance than all of human history
because of our recent adoptions of modern technology.
Pretty much all current communications technology leaks metadata
such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item geographical location
\item message sender
\item message receiver
\item message send time
\item message receive time
\item size of the message
\item message sequence
\end{itemize}

\newpage

The people operating our communications infrastructure
get to learn who our friends are, their geographical locations and
our frequency of communications etc.

In practice, this information is available to the large powerful
nation states because they can simply gag order and subpoena the
communications infrastructure operators.

End to end encryption of your communications is important, however
services and communication programs like Signal, Wire and WhatsApp do
indeed give us end to end encryption.

That's not good enough. All the above metadata is still leaked, the man learns
with whom you are communicating with because that cannot be ``encrypted''.

\newpage

What is anonymous communication?

Anonymous communication allows us to communicate more freely because
it protects the identities or geographical locations of the people we
are communicating with, from the operators of the communications
infrastructure.

Currently, Tor is the most successful anonymous communication network.
However, it has very weak anonymity properties which can be trivially
broken by sufficiently global passive adversaries.

A sufficiently global passive adversary is any adversary or set of colluding
adversaries (e.g. the set of cooperating nation states + drug cartels + corporations)
who are able to observe your entry and exit, into and out of the Tor network.

Simple statistical correlation is made between your input and output packets flowing
into and out of the Tor network.

Tor is not strong anonymity.

\newpage

There is not any solution right now that we'd recommend except to say
that if you really are a person in a very high risk situation with
very powerful adversaries, then you had better not use ANY modern
communications infrastructure in your communications with your
communication correspondents.

Old school technology still works but doesn't have strong
confidentiality guarantees. Use the night's cover of darkness,
whispers, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes,
couriers and dead drops.

\newpage

The katzenpost team is a group of cypherpunks that are dedicated to
building strongly anonymous communications networks that everyone can
use to communicate more freely.

To quote the cypherpunk's manifesto:

``Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software
to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do,
we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow
Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to
use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the
software we write. We know that software can't be destroyed and that a
widely dispersed system can't be shut down. ``

\newpage

We conclude that the age old communications privacy problem hasn't yet
been solved. There is no modern and effective strongly anonymous
communications network. The old methods of protecting our privacy
might not have the strongest security guarantees compared to using
modern end to end encryption like Signal, WhatsApp. But at least the
old methods don't snitch about who you are communcating with; whereas
Signal and WhatsApp by design cannot prevent the identities of your
communication correspondants from being discovered by adversaries who
compromise the communications infrastructure.
